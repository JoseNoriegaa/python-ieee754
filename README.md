# An IEEE 754 implementation in Python 3.


## Description
A few algorithms to convert float numbers into its binary representation based on IEEE 754 and vice versa.

> Notice: I made this project for learning purposes. I was thinking about the float number precision errors that many programming languages ​​have, so I decided to get into the problem and understand how this kind of numbers are stored in memory and how they are interpreted by the CPU.
